# @totalpave/regression

This module was forked from [regression-js](https://github.com/Tom-Alexander/regression-js). Props to Tom Alexander for making this great library.

This module has been modified to have typings as well as some additional features to save and restore regression states without having the original data that formed the regression equation.

This module is no longer a drop in replacement.
